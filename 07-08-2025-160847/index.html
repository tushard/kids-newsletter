      <h2>Why Do We Have Hair on Our Heads?</h2>
      
        <p>Did you ever wonder why people have fur only on their heads and not all over their bodies like many animals? Scientists think it helped our early human ancestors stay cool in the hot sun. Strands of hair made a little air cushion that stopped too much heat from reaching their skin.</p>
      
        <p>Over time, these ancestors stood up tall and walked on two feet, which meant their heads got extra sunshine. Having a head full of hair, especially curly or dense hair, was like wearing a natural sunhat. It also protected their developing brains. As these humans moved into different parts of the world, their hair came in many colors and textures, from straight to wavy, to suit new climates.</p>

      <h2>Keep Your Shoes On at Airport Security</h2>
      
        <p>If you‚Äôve ever traveled with family, you might remember taking off your shoes at airport security. Soon, though, travelers will get to keep their shoes on! The Transportation Security Administration is testing new ways to make screening faster, so passport holders can walk right through without shoelaces coming off.</p>
      
        <p>This change is thanks to new machines and improved training for security officers. The rule started back in 2001 when a passenger tried to hide something in his shoe. Now security checks are smarter, and technology can spot anything dangerous without you having to peel off your sneakers.</p>

      <h2>Making Lithium From Salty Water</h2>
      
        <p>Imagine turning salty water into a battery ingredient! A clever group of engineers has built a special cell that can scoop lithium‚Äîan important part of many batteries‚Äîright out of salty water, or ‚Äúbrine.‚Äù Their secret is a material that works like a battery‚Äôs own part: it grabs lithium ions and holds onto them.</p>
      
        <p>This new way could be faster and cleaner than older methods. Right now, getting lithium can take months in sun-heated ponds. With this new cell, scientists hope to make battery ingredients in hours, using less water and energy. That means more batteries for electric cars and gadgets, and a happier planet.</p>

      <h2>Prime Day: Amazon‚Äôs Big Summer Sale</h2>
      
        <p>Every summer, Amazon has a special shopping event called Prime Day. It‚Äôs like Black Friday in July! For a few days, shoppers can find big discounts on toys, electronics, home goods and more. Last year, people in the U.S. spent almost $13 billion during Prime Day.</p>
      
        <p>Stores get busy because some prices might go up later, especially on electronics that could face extra taxes. To stand out, sellers often offer extra deals on things like kitchen gadgets or video games. Amazon even shows off its shopping tools so families can find just the right gift. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a new tablet, headphones or LEGO sets, Prime Day is a fun time to hunt for deals!</p>

      <h2>How Flash Floods Happen‚Äîand Why We Must Be Careful</h2>
      
        <p>Flash floods are when heavy rain causes rivers and creeks to rise very quickly. In places with steep hills and rocky ground, rainwater can‚Äôt soak into the soil. Instead, it rushes downhill in powerful waves, going from low to high in just minutes!</p>
      
        <p>Because floods can come without much warning, it‚Äôs important to watch the sky and listen for alerts from weather services. If you hear a flash-flood warning, stay away from streams and low bridges. And at home or camp, move to higher ground fast! Nature can be surprising, but by paying attention, we keep ourselves and our families safe.</p>
