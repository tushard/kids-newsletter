      <h2>A Time-Travel Snack Adventure with King Tut</h2>
      
        <p>Imagine tasting the foods that ancient people enjoyed thousands of years ago ‚Äì from crunchy crackers in Egypt to hearty stews in Rome! In the new book "Dinner With King Tut," science writer Sam Kean goes on a real-life detective hunt with experts who recreate recipes, build old-fashioned kitchen tools and even sample snacks made the ancient way.</p>
      
        <p>Sam learns how to bake Egyptian bread using only the ingredients people had long ago and visits a group of kids in Louisiana who spin wool into cloth just like medieval villagers. He even tries stone-cold tattoos with special inks, and you might be brave enough to taste roasted grasshoppers from Mexico just like people did back then. It‚Äôs a fun, hands-on trip into history ‚Äì a tasty museum you can munch!</p>

      <h2>Celebrating the Dalai Lama‚Äôs 90th Birthday</h2>
      
        <p>This summer, people from many countries gathered in the green hills of northern India to wish the Dalai Lama a joyful 90th birthday. They sang songs, performed traditional dances and cut a giant cake with nine colorful layers! Everywhere you looked, there were bright flags, smiling faces and videos of friends sending happy wishes from around the world.</p>
      
        <p>The Dalai Lama is a spiritual leader who teaches kindness, patience and compassion. Children waved small Tibetan flags, and families joined together in cheerful birthday songs. Even though he lives far from his native home of Tibet, his gentle smile and caring words bring hope to millions. It was a joyful day full of music, ballet dances and lots of birthday cheer!</p>

      <h2>How Weather Warnings Helped Families in Texas</h2>
      
        <p>One night in Texas, heavy rains began to fall fast and furious over towns and rivers. Forecasters at the National Weather Service watched raindrops piling up and worked quickly to send out flash-flood watches and warnings. These special alerts popped up on phones and sounded on radios, telling people to move to higher ground so they could stay safe.</p>
      
        <p>Thanks to those warnings, families who were sleeping or camping near rivers heard the messages in time. They packed their cars, grabbed their pets and followed safe routes out of the flood zone. Rescue teams stood by ready to help, and no one got stuck without a plan. It shows how listening to weather updates and taking them seriously can protect lives when storms roll in!</p>
