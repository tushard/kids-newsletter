      <h2>America‚Äôs Big 200th Birthday Party</h2>
      
        <p>In 1976, America turned 200 years old! People all around the country planned parades, concerts and fireworks to celebrate this ‚Äúbicentennial.‚Äù In Boston, the famous Pops Orchestra played music for over 400,000 cheering fans beside the Charles River. In Washington, D.C., Johnny Cash was the grand marshal leading a huge parade down Constitution Avenue. Even St. Louis set up air shows with brave wing walkers flying on top of airplanes!</p>
      
        <p>Each city made its own special party‚ÄîNew York filled its harbor with tall ships, Los Angeles threw a celebration on Wilshire Boulevard and in Ontario, California, they built a 2-mile-long picnic table! The Freedom Train, pulled by a steam locomotive, traveled to all 48 contiguous states, showing Americans their country‚Äôs history from coast to coast. It was a time when families, friends and neighbors came together to remember why America is special and to say, ‚ÄúHappy Birthday!‚Äù</p>

      <h2>Why Visiting Some Parks Will Cost a Little More</h2>
      
        <p>Have you ever visited a national park‚Äîplaces like Yellowstone, Yosemite or the Grand Canyon? These parks are run by the government, and they used to charge the same fee for everyone. Now, President Trump has asked park leaders to add a small extra charge for visitors from other countries. The extra money will help fix old trails, make restrooms cleaner and keep the parks safe and beautiful.</p>
      
        <p>Already, more than 100 parks charge entrance fees, but this new plan will make sure all visitors‚Äîboth from the U.S. and from abroad‚Äîhelp take care of the land. If you‚Äôre an American visiting a park, the fee stays the same. If you‚Äôre visiting from another country, there will be a little extra added on. That way, the parks can stay in great shape for kids like you, grandchildren, families and friends to explore for many years to come!</p>

      <h2>When Donuts Met the Golden Arches</h2>
      
        <p>Imagine a giant donut shop teaming up with McDonald‚Äôs! In 2022, Krispy Kreme doughnuts began popping up at some McDonald‚Äôs restaurants. People loved the idea of buying a fresh, warm donut right along with their hot fries and burgers. At first, Krispy Kreme delivered to just nine McDonald‚Äôs shops in Kentucky as a test, then grew to more than 2,500 locations!</p>
      
        <p>But making and delivering so many donuts was trickier than people thought. Some restaurants ran out of donuts, and others got too many they couldn‚Äôt sell. Doughnuts sometimes arrived a little cold or without enough sprinkles. Krispy Kreme found it hard to keep up with the big demand, and doughnut sales at McDonald‚Äôs started to drop. In May 2025, the two companies decided to stop their donut deal. Even though the experiment ended, it was exciting to see two favorite treats‚ÄîMcDonald‚Äôs and Krispy Kreme‚Äîgive it a try together!</p>
